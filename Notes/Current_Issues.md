- Currently, if someone meets over half of the symptoms, conditions, and risk factors
for a specific pathology, then the contact for that disease is given, or they are
  recommended to go to the emergency room as these are all serious pathologies. However,
  at this time that 50% value is arbitrary. I will research to develop a more thought-out method
  of recommending going to the emergency room or just a family doctor depending on the specific
  combination of occurring symptoms, risk factors, and conditions for each pathology.
