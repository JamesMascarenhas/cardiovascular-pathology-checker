# cardiovascular-pathology-checker

## Description
- The purpose of this project is to provide individuals who have cardiovascular symptoms with a trustworthy tool for telling them what is likely causing their symptoms
- This project is meant to combat the misinformation of looking up symptoms online which tends to return an overly severe illness and can scare people
- The information for this project is derived from a cardiovascular textbook given to medical students at the University of Ottawa and from the Mayo Clinic
- This project will first be released to medical students as a means of studying, and if successful will be made available to the public
